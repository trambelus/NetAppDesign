Running project in Python 3:

Note: Python 3.2 is preinstalled on the Pi, but `pip install tweepy` installs a version that isn't backward-compatible, and looks like it was meant for 3.4. Rather than find an old version of tweepy (a small library with little support), I decided to upgrade to Python 3.4 on my Pi.

`sudo apt-get install python3 --upgrade` did nothing: the Raspbian repo had 3.2 as its latest version. Manual installation was in order.

First step was FTP download:
	$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/Python-3.4.3.tgz
and building/installation:
	$ cd Python-3.4.3
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

And then I needed to install pip for this version of Python.
	$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
	$ sudo python3.4 get-pip.py

Failure. No SSL support had been detected on the build, so Python compiled without HTTPS support.

So:
	$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
Failure. Packages were out of date.
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

And then the configure/make/install steps were repeated.

Success.
